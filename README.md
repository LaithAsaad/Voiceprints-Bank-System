The system captures and extracts voiceprints from
user recordings, storing them in a database for
indexing. When a new voice is provided, it extracts
the voiceprint and uses the index to find the most
similar matches. Clustering techniques are applied
to automatically remove unnecessary voiceprints,
optimizing storage and enhancing database
efficiency.
