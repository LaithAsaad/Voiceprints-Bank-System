# **Voiceprint Recognition System**
The system captures and extracts voiceprints from user recordings, storing them in a database for indexing. When a new voice is provided, it extracts the voiceprint and uses the index to find the most similar matches. Clustering techniques are applied to automatically remove unnecessary voiceprints, optimizing storage and enhancing database efficiency.
